# project4_Mandy_Heather
A repository for the CMSC132 Project 4 Game Implementation (Spring 2024, Elias Gonzalez)

# Description from ELMS
Description: In this project, you will use what you know about inheritance and inner classes to implement a game of your choosing.

A few quick notes:
I'm providing you with some distribution code -- courtesy of Samir Paul -- that displays a black screen. Your job in this project will be to take the blank screen and make a game of your choosing. Start early!
For this project, you will be able to work on your own OR with one other person. You must write your names at the top of every class in the required javadoc comments (see code requirements).

This README will be updated when the project is finished
